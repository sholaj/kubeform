                    that monitors your Linode and will reboot it if it powers off
                    unexpectedly. It works by issuing a boot job when your Linode
                    powers off without a shutdown job being responsible. To prevent
                    a loop, Lassie will give up if there have been more than 5 boot
                    jobs issued within 15 minutes.
